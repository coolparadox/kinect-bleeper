kinect-bleeper
==============

Obstacle avoidance using sounds and openkinect.

This routine is a proof-of-concept on using the Microsoft Kinect(tm) sensor as
an assistive technology device for the visually impaired. By parsing Kinect's
depth information stream, this routine detects the nearest object and then
express its relative position in the field of view using sounds.

The horizontal position of the nearest object is encoded by the left-right audio
balance of speakers, the vertical position is encoded by the tone of bleeps, and
the distance to the nearest object is encoded by the repetition rate of bleeps.

Tested in indoor environments only. Engineering efforts are required to address
hardware bulk issues before a setup suited for practical daily usage can be
achieved.
